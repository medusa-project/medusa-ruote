To run a small demo, run the start-demo.sh script from the top level of the project.

This will create three data directories, 'in', 'out', and 'processing', as well
as a 'ruote-storage' directory for the workflow processing.
It starts two daemons. One watches the in directory for new subdirectories
eligible for processing and receives messages from remote amqp participants.
The other is a service that is a remote amqp participant.

It then copies the 'test-items' directory into 'in' and changes its name
to 'test-items_ready', which signals that it is ready for processing.

The daemons will then do the following:

1. Notice that there is a processable directory in 'in'
2. Move it to 'processing'
3. Add a file with checksums for each original file.
4. Add a file with file type for each original file (and the checksum file)
5. Finish processing by moving the directory to 'out'

So after a few seconds you should be able to look in 'out/test-items' and
see all this.

To stop the daemons, run the stop-demo.sh script.
